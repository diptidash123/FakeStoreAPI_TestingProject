Update Product – API (Test Cases)

Update product with valid product ID and correct request payload
→ Verify that the API successfully updates the product and returns 200 OK with updated product details in the response.

Attempt to update product using an invalid HTTP method (POST instead of PUT/PATCH)
→ Verify that the API returns 404 Not Found (or appropriate method-related error), indicating the endpoint does not support the requested HTTP method.
